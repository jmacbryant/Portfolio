Note to potential employers:

This Portfolio is nothing more than a small, supplemental snapshot of a few various projects I have worked on in my own free time.
All projects presented here highlight the interest I have had in exploratory learning and tinkering with fun little coding projects outside of an academic or professional setting.
The projects I have worked on in a professional setting, and some academic settings, are far more complex and nuanced than anything displayed here.
Unfortunately, most, if not all projects I have worked on in a professional setting are under strict NDA's and cannot be showcased in any form or fashion.

This is by no means a comprehensive portfolio of all works professional, academic, or otherwise.
Just a few fun projects to show that I am not only experienced in this field but I actually thoroughly enjoy the art that is computer programming.

Hope you enjoy!
