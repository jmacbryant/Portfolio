When you first load MushroomMauler it will say, "Type anything to play".

Type "DinoDoogo" (case sensitive, and WITHOUT the quotation marks) to activate cheat-codes.

If done correctly, there are two cheat-codes you can use:
 -Hit the g-key to toggle "God-Mode" (invincibility & instant kills with bullets)
 -Hit the l-key to skip levels (only a forward-skip, you can't go backwards in levels)

These codes are so it is easier to see the full game and its intricacies without having
to play it all the way through (because it's actually pretty hard).
